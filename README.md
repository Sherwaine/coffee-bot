# Coffee Bot

Welcome to the **Coffee Bot**! This is a simple interactive Python program that simulates a coffee shop ordering system. It prompts users to select their drink size, type, and milk preference, and generates a summary of the order before asking for their name.

## Features

- Choose from different drink sizes (small, medium, large).
- Select your drink type (brewed coffee, mocha, or latte).
- Customize your latte with different milk options (2% milk, non-fat milk, soy milk).
- Get a summary of your order before finalizing it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sherwaine/coffee-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd coffee-bot
   ```

3. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can verify your Python version by running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

## How to Run

1. To run the program, simply execute the `coffee_bot.py` file in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python coffee_bot.py
   ```

2. The bot will guide you through a series of questions:
   - Choose a drink size (small, medium, or large).
   - Select your drink type (brewed coffee, mocha, or latte).
   - If you choose a latte, select a milk type (2% milk, non-fat milk, or soy milk).
   - Finally, provide your name, and the bot will give you a confirmation message.

## Sample Output

Here's an example of how the program might look when you run it:

```
